% INPUTS
% X                --- contains the data (nxd) matrix , where n is the
%                      number of feature vectors and d is the dimensionality 
%                      of each feature vector 
% parent_number    --- Internal variable .... Donot Assign 
% split_dimension  --- Internal variable .... Donot Assign 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUTS
% tree_output --- contains the a array of structs, each struct is a node 
%                 node in the tree. The size of the array is equal to the 
%                 the number of feature vectors in the data matrix X 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% each struct in the output cell array contains the following information 
% left        -  (tree) left tree node location in the array 
% right       -  (tree) right tree node location in the array 
% numpoints   -  number of points in this node 
% nodevector  -  the median of the data along dimension that it is split 
% hyperrect   -  (2xd) hyperrectangle bounding the points 
% type        -  'leaf' = node is leaf
%                'node' = node has 2 children
% parent      -  the location of the parent of the current node in the
%                struct array 
% index       -  the index of the feature vector in the original matrix 
%                that was used to build the tree
% splitdim    -  the dimension along which the split is made 
% splitval    -  the value along that dimension in which the split is made
